  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>This is the only crispy fried chicken recipe you'll ever need. Why? It combines all the tried-and-true tricks to
    ensure the juiciest, most flavorful, crispiest chicken every time. </p>

  <h5>Ingredients</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>4 pound chicken, cut into pieces</li>
    <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>2 quarts vegetable oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Steps</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer. </li>
    <li>Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you
      use). Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken). </li>
    <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and
      shake to coat well.</li>
    <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT
      UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL! </li>
    <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides. </li>
    <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not
      crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy. </li>
  </ol>
